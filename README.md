Welcome to Picking Up Time, the web application designed to streamline the pickup process for parents, guides, and children. Below is a guide on how to use the application:

Once you've logged in, you'll be taken to the main dashboard where you can view your child's pickup schedule. From here, you can change pickup times, as well as view any special notes or instructions from your child's guide.

To ensure maximum security, we've integrated Twilio's phone verification service for user authentication. This means that each time you log in, you'll receive a verification code via text message that you'll need to enter in order to access the app.

Thank you for using Picking Up Time! We hope that this application makes your life easier and your child's pickup process smoother.
